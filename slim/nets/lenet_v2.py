  """Creates a variant of the LeNet model.

  Note that since the output is a set of 'logits', the values fall in the
  interval of (-infinity, infinity). Consequently, to convert the outputs to a
  probability distribution over the characters, one will need to convert them
  using the softmax function:

        logits = lenet.lenet(images, is_training=False)
        probabilities = tf.nn.softmax(logits)
        predictions = tf.argmax(logits, 1)

  Args:
    images: A batch of `Tensors` of size [batch_size, height, width, channels].
    num_classes: the number of classes in the dataset.
    is_training: specifies whether or not we're currently training the model.
      This variable will determine the behaviour of the dropout layer.
    dropout_keep_prob: the percentage of activation values that are retained.
    prediction_fn: a function to get predictions out of logits.
    scope: Optional variable_scope.

  Returns:
    logits: the pre-softmax activations, a tensor of size
      [batch_size, `num_classes`]
    end_points: a dictionary from components of the network to the corresponding
      activation.
